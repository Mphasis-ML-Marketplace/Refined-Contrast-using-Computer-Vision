# Refined-Contrast-using-Computer-Vision

## Product overview

Scanned documents sometimes can have pages with low contrast and low brightness. This can create challenges while processing of documents viz. OCR, ICR, Text extraction, image-based ML/AI modelling, etc. This solution incorporates statistical models which identify the contrast between background and text in the pages of the scanned document and adjust the contrast of the low contrast pages. It then enhances the brightness and text visibility if it finds text to have lost thickness.This enables OCR / ICR engines to achieve higher accuracy and improves the subsequent text extraction pipelines.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be used to correct contrast and brightness issues which occur while scanning a document with scanner or phone or images captured in low light.

* To correct the contrast and brightness of the pages, this solution performs operations on each pixel of the image and runs statistical models to identify the variation in pixel colors. These variations are fed to equations to calculate the correct adjustment of contrast for each pixel.

* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
